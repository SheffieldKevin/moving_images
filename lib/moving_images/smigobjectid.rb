module MovingImages
  # Making Ruby hashes that identify MovingImage's objects and filters.    
  # The method makeid_withobjectreference creates an object identifier which
  # we can use to refer to the object with. Since the object reference is the
  # most efficient way to refer to an object it is the preferred way and so
  # it is the first method checked for when creating the object identifier.
  # The methods, makeid_withobjectypeandname, & makeid_withfilternameid
  # create a ruby hash that identifies a filter in a filter chain.
  # The base object hashes are used for identifying an object for when we want to
  # send messages to the object via methods, or when the object is a source for
  # an image that can be used for drawing into a context, adding to an image 
  # exporter object or as an input image for a filter in a filter chain. Since
  # a filter's output image in a filter chain can be an input image for another
  # filter in the same filter chain the two methods makeid_withfilternameid, and
  # makeid_withfilterindex allow a filter to be identified so that it's output
  # image can be used as an input image for another filter in the same filter
  # filter chain.
